"use strict";
// as const is a type assertion in TypeScript that allows you to assert that an expression has a specific type, and
// that its value should be treated as a read-only value.
//
//     For example:
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
// colors is now of type readonly ['red', 'green', 'blue']
